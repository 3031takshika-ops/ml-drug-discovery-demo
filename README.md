Machine Learning Demo: Molecular Property Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow inspired by
drug discovery applications. A neural network is trained to predict a
continuous molecular property using numerical features.

The goal is to showcase data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
using PyTorch.

This is a demonstration project intended for academic and research roles.
